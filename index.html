					<h3>Lehman NSBE First Annual Hackathon 2014</h3>
				</hgroup>
					<img class = "textwrap" src = images/hack.jpg />

				<p > On Nov 14, 2014, The Lehman College National Society Of Black Engineers (Lehman NSBE) Chapter hosted their first annual 12-hour Hackathon. The President Of Lehman NSBE, Dana Smith, had previously won with her team a hackathon sponsored by Google at the March 2014 NSBE Annual Convention. She thought it was necessary to bring this experience Lehman college students to give them the opportunity to engineer interesting pieces of software while collaborating with a group. A hackathon simulates real-world software development but in a condensed period. <br>
				
				<br>Lehman NSBE Chapter with assistance of MCSLC and some Lehman College Professors recruited participants for the hackathon early on by advertising in multiple classrooms, other CUNY campuses as well as other NSBE Chapters more than 130 students registered but only 100 students were chosen to participate. Students came from Lehman College, Brooklyn College, Bronx Community College, City College, Columbia University, City College, New York City College of Technology, Baruch College, Borough of Manhattan Community College, John Jay College and LaGuardia Community College. <br>

<br>The hackathon competition consisted of twenty teams of five people each. Seven judges were present, joined by several technical experts that were available to assist any students with technical questions. The teams were asked to develop a technical solution to one of five real world problems using real world tools and applications. The students worked for twelve consecutive hours toward their chosen challenge.  Students felt that they accomplished more in twelve hours than they imagined. <br>

<br> The first place award went out to a team from Brooklyn College, who created Hack The Vote. This project involved a website containing an embedded game in Java. The goal of Hack The Vote is to round up as many people as possible within a timed period and take them to the voting booth. The user would then post their score via social media, with the intention that the friends of this user would then try to beat their high score. The overall intention of this game is to get more people to vote, especially after this year’s low number of voters. <br>

 <br> All participants received a certificate of participation in appreciation of contributing to the overall experience. The hackathon was a great success and all the judges were impressed with the quality of work that was presented. A few professors commented: <br>

“It was a very good experience for the students. We need to do this again next year.” 
-	Professor Murphy, Department Chair of Math & Computer Science at Lehman College.
<br>

<br> “It was very well organized, well managed, and detailed oriented. I am very impressed with the quality of work. I loved that it offered our students a real life experience and group problem solving that will be a valuable experience to the students.” <br>
-	Professor Fakhouri, NSBE Lehman advisor and Internship Coordinator Lehman College.
<br>


<br> “It was an exciting event, the students learned a lot and the effects of this event are more profound than what the students understood. These types of events should continue to occur so the students will be motivated to create and produce great quality results. ” <br>
-      Professor Madramootoo, Math and Computer Science Learning Center             Coordinator Lehman College. 
<br>

 <br> NSBE Lehman will host Second Annual Hackathon October 3rd 2015.
